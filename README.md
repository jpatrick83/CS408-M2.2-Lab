# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.


## Development

Most of the development straight forward. Did do a quick google search on how to add a unordered list and some basic css guide lines. 
For me founding a free image for me background, and making it opaque so front was readable, was the hardest point. It took a little 
google and stack overflow research.


## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
